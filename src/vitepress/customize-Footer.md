# Customize Footer

Its a piece of Cake. Even a little cat can do it.

## Quick Note

All i can say everything is done in:

```mjs:line-numbers [/.vitepress/config.mjs]
import { defineConfig } from "vitepress";

export default defineConfig({
  themeConfig: {
    // ==> in here <==
  },
});
```

Now go to the docs.

## Reference

Head to the official docs. its a very small section TBH
